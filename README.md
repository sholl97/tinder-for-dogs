Welcome to Barkr!

This app is the best way to find a dog to adopt, with a tinder-style swiping mechanic.

If you are running this locally, please make sure you have npm and node installed locally. Than, simply navigate to the directory that this project is in and run "nodemon app" or your preffered means of starting the node app. Than, in a browser, open http://localhost:8081/, or whichever port you are running this in.
