Welcome to Barkr! This is a group project by Sam Holland, Sophie Trotto, and Lucas Weiner for Database & Information Systems (CIS 550) at the University of Pennsylvania.

Barkr app is the best way to find a dog to adopt, with a tinder-style swiping mechanic.

If you are running this locally, please make sure you have npm and node installed on your machine. Then simply navigate to the directory of this project and run "nodemon app", "node app", or your preferred means of starting up node. Than, in Google Chrome, open http://localhost:8081/ (if you change the port where this server is running, you will need to adjust this URL).

***NOTE***: This class wrapped up in December 2019, and our AWS credits have expired. Please check out our [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1acSLro-0qLZJYGmbB4p5u22LNGiC2D0d/view?usp=sharing "Barkr demo video") to see the app in action.
