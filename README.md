Welcome to Barkr!

This app is the best way to find a dog to adopt, with a tinder-style swiping mechanic.

If you are running this locally, please make sure you have npm and node installed on your machine. Then simply navigate to the directory of this project and run "nodemon app", "node app", or your preferred means of starting up node. Than, in Google Chrome, open http://localhost:8081/ (if you change the port where this server is running, you will need to adjust this URL).
